## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a local `data.json` to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!
